This project, called Study Scheduler, was created to help people budget their time better in order to be more productive and be more efficient.
By accessing the user's Google calendars, we then prompt them to choose which calendars they wish to use. Afterwards, they will enter an
assignment, listing the title, class name, number of days, and number of hours expected to complete it. The project will then assign the user a 
schedule that will cooperate with the user's preexisting schedule on their chosen Google calendars.
